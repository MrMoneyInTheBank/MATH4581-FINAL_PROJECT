# MATH4581-FINAL_PROJECT

This project implements Viterbi's algorithm for decoding problems in python using dynamic programming.

Source code is in functions.py, with testcases script setup in functions_test.py. Each testcase was calculated by hand to test against. Each test case is also given a close look in their respective files.
